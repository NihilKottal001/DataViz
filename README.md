Project Overview

In this project, we will be analyzing the performance metrics of UFC fighters to understand patterns and predict outcomes in competitive matches. The primary data source for this analysis will be the comprehensive datasets available from the Kaggle website, which includes detailed records of every fight, fighter attributes, match outcomes, and in-depth performance metrics such as strikes, takedowns, and defensive maneuvers. By applying machine learning techniques, specifically regression analysis and clustering, we aim to model the fighting styles and predict the effectiveness of different strategies used by fighters. Insights from this analysis will potentially reveal underlying patterns in fight outcomes, identify key performance indicators for winning matches, and assist in developing tailored training programs for fighters.
